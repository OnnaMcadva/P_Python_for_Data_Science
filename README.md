# Python for Data Science

A comprehensive Python learning journey designed to build foundational skills in data science, covering everything from basic Python syntax to advanced object-oriented programming and data manipulation techniques.

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a structured curriculum divided into five main modules, each focusing on essential Python concepts for data science applications.  The project follows a progressive learning path with hands-on exercises (ex00-exXX) in each module.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master Python fundamentals and syntax
- Understand array operations with NumPy
- Work with data structures using Pandas DataFrames
- Apply object-oriented programming principles
- Implement data-oriented design patterns

- Best practices for data science code

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE (optional)

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OnnaMcadva/P_Python_for_Data_Science.git
cd P_Python_for_Data_Science
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment: 
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas jupyter
```

## 🎓 How to Use

1. **Sequential Learning**: Start with Module 0 and progress through each module in order
2. **Exercise-Based**:  Each module contains numbered exercises (ex00, ex01, etc.)
3. **Hands-On Practice**: Work through each exercise to reinforce concepts
4. **Build Foundation**: Each module builds upon previous knowledge

### Example Workflow
```bash
# Navigate to a module
cd "00 - Starting"

# Work through exercises sequentially
cd ex00
python solution.py  # Run your solution

# Move to next exercise
cd ../ex01
```
